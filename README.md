# bachelor's thesis
this repository contains the code for my bachelor's thesis that i wrote in 2018. the topic was about the distribution of quadratic residues which comes from the field of number theory. \
fun fact: most of my sources were published before 1930. so actually an late 19th or early 20th century fabian could have written the same thesis

in the course of my bachelors thesis we found an upper bound for the number of n consecutively following quadratic residues that was based on the weil bound. furthermore, we identified the scalar in front of the square root error term of p and found a way to reduce the original scalar
